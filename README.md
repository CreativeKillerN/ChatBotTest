
The provided Code of a C++ question-answering chatbot is a highly simplified version compared to the capabilities of advanced models like GPT-3. While the chatbot can respond to predefined questions with pre-programmed answers, it lacks the sophistication of GPT-3's natural language understanding and generation. GPT-3 employs deep learning techniques to comprehend a broad array of inputs and generate contextually relevant and coherent responses. In contrast, the simplified chatbot relies on basic string matching and predefined responses. GPT-3's immense training data and model complexity enable it to understand context, nuance, and even generate creative content across various topics, whereas the basic chatbot is confined to a limited set of pre-defined questions and responses. The comparison underscores the vast complexity and advancement that models like GPT-3 bring to natural language processing and generation tasks

Please note that I am most likely not going to finish this Bot this year as it will need limitations and its own languange :)
